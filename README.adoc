= Schulich Epsilon Onboard Media Control

This program is an onboard media control for the University of Calgary's Solar Car Team in Schulich Epsilon. The program features a music player on the Raspberry Pi.

== The Plan
:imagesdir: assets/images
image::plan.jpg[Plan]

== Acquiring Album Art

In order to rip the jpg pics off the mp3 files a script from eyeD3 is used. Run the following line in the linux terminal once to aquire the program:

`sudo apt-get install eyeD3`

Some pictures are downloaded as png files. To keep everything in jpg format, a command will be run to convert all png files to jpg files. To aquire the commands for file formatting run:

`sudo apt-get install imagemagick`

== Installing libmpg123 and libao
The media player uses libmpg123 and libao to decode and play music files. Run the following commands to install them:

`git clone https://github.com/gypified/libmpg123.git`

`(cd libmpg123 && ./configure && make && sudo make install)`

`sudo apt-get install libao-dev --yes`

.TODO list
- Add requirements to get onboard media control running.
- Add how to run the onboard media control.
- Add media control features here after it is finished.
